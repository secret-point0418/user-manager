# User Management CRUD Application

This is a simple user management CRUD application. The backend is implemented using Kotlin and Spring Boot and the frontend is built with React.js and TypeScript. The application allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting users. Each user has a name, email, age, and phone number. The age of the user is fetched from the endpoint: `https://api.agify.io/?name=?`.
